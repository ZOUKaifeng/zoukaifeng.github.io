In our daily life, the most common media we see are images, videos and sounds. One feature of this data is that they are neatly arranged. For example, the pixels of an image can be represented by a matrix which is an an underlying Euclidean or grid-like structure (Fig 1.). Thanks to this property, convolutional neural networks have had great success with 2d picture and speech data. (Fig 2.)<br>
