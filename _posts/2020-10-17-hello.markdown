In our daily life, the most common media we see are images, videos and sounds. One feature of this data is that they are neatly arranged. For example, the pixels of an image can be represented by a matrix which is an an underlying Euclidean or grid-like structure (Fig 1.). Thanks to this property, convolutional neural networks have had great success with 2d picture. (Fig 2.). <br>

However, many scientific fields study data with an underlying structure that is a non-Euclidean space. Some examples include social networks in computational social sciences, sensor networks in communications, functional networks in brain imaging, regulatory networks in genetics, and meshed surfaces in computer graphics. (Fig 3.)

In a lot of application of such dataset, such geometric datasets are large and complex, we should consider the feature of each node as well as the connectivity. Anyway, graph is a nature targets for machine learning techology, since important real-world datasets come in the form of graphs or networks. In particular, we would like to use deep learning.
Fortunately, more and more researches show that it's feasible to apply convolution neural network on the graph and even proved that it's a powerful tool in graph representation learning. The graph convolution is divided into two main categories -- spectral method and space method.

**Spectral method**
We define a mesh as a set of vertices and edges, $$G=(V, A)$$

**Spatial method**
