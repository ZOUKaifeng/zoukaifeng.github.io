> Life goes on. 

Hi, I'm Kaifeng Zou. I graduated from [Huazhong University of Science and Technology](https://www.hust.edu.cn/) for my undergraduate degree, and then came to the University of Strasbourg [Télécom Physique](http://www.telecom-physique.fr/) for my master's degree and majored in image and data. In 2020, this is my third year in France, and I'm ashamed to say that my French isn't very good and I'm still surviving with my broken English...I will continue my PhD in the [ICube](https://icube.unistra.fr/) lab, studying medical image processing.

My current areas of interest are computer vision, computer graphics, and statistics. Here I will publish some study notes or open source some project code in English.

I can't really think of much more to say about myself, but I'd be happy if you'd read something useful in my blog.
